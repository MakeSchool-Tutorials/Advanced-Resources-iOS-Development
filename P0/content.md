The iOS developer community is great because it has many members that are contributing interesting talks, articles and blog posts. There are so many resources out there that it's hard to get a good overview. This article points to some really interesting resources for advanced iOS developers.

#Blogs & Journals

##Objc.io

Objc.io is a monthly publication that has been around since mid 2013. Each issue covers one subject of iOS development through a collection of different articles. The articles are very detailed and mostly focus on cutting-edge frameworks and techniques. Reading objc.io is a great way of staying in touch with the latest trends in the iOS developer community.

##NSHipster

NSHipster posts weekly articles on the *overlooked bits in Objective-C, Swift, and Cocoa*. It focuses a lot on the beauty of Apple's APIs and how they can be leveraged to write better code. Many iOS developers only work with a very small subset of available APIs. If you want to get a good overview of interesting language features and frameworks you might have missed out on, this is a great resource for you.

##mikeash.com

Mike Ash's Friday Q&A has been around for ages (the first post dates back to December 2008!). The topics covered in his blog are relevant to iOS and OS X development. Most posts discuss compiler details, runtime features, or other very interesting low-level details. If you want to get a better grasp of what is going on under all the highly abstracted APIs you are using, this blog is a great place to start.

#Podcasts

##NSBrief

NSBrief is a very entertaining podcast that doesn't only cover technical topics. Each episode introduces an interesting iOS developer from the community. The episodes are recorded in an interview style, mixing personal questions with very technical ones. Until the end of 2014 this podcast was run by [Saul Mora](https://twitter.com/casademora), the developer of Magical Record. Now [Janie Clayton](@redqueencoder) is hosting the show. It will be interesting to see if the format changes a little.

A great way to get to know more people in the iOS developer community.

##Ray Wenderlich Podcast

Most episodes feature a member of the Ray Wenderlich tutorial team discussing one specific topic. If you want to use a new framework or technique and don't feel like reading a long article to begin with, you should find a lot of interesting episodes here.

#Talks

##Apple's WWDC Talks

Apple's WWDC talks are the number one resource for many topics. The engineers that work on Apple's tools and frameworks give interesting talks on new features and best practices. Especially WWDC 2014 has very interesting talks introducing Swift and a vast amount of new frameworks. Note that you need Safari to watch the WWDC talks.

##Swift Language User Group

The Swift Language User Group is the largest Swift meetup in the world! Talks happen every two weeks, switching locations between San Francisco and Silicon Valley). If you can't make it out here in person, you can still watch the talks online. Realm, the company that hosts the meetups, publishes all talks along with the speaker's slides on their website. Another great way to learn from experienced iOS developers.
